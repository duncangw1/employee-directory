# # 19 React: Employee Directory

## Description

The purpose of the Employee Directory application is to allow an employee or manager to be able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. The Employee Directory was built using React, allowing the structure of the application to be broken up into UI components and allowing for the application to respond to user events (filtering employees by name). Please view the deployed application [here](https://duncangw1.github.io/employee-directory/) or navigate to the [Installation](#installation) section below for instructions on how to run the application locally.
